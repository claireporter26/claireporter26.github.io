            <h1 class="pageMain_header">My Skills</h1>

            <p class="skillstext">I currently have basic skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript and am improving my skills every day. I have designed a few 
            websites already and enjoy the challenge that comes with learning new techniques</p>
        
            </br>

            <div id="skill1">
            <h4>HTML5</h4>
            <p>HTML online courses are where I started learning web development. I have then used this knowledge to help me learn further skills, each time using some HTML as the base. 
                Because of this I understand how important this is.</p>
            </div>

            </br>

            <div id="skill2">
            <h4>CSS</h4>
            <p>From the basic HTML skills I then moved onto learning CSS. This quickly became one of my favourite languages 
                as it had the ability to change basic text into colourful designs with great layouts.</p>
            </div>

        
            </br>

            <div id="skill3">
            <h4>Javascript</h4>
            <p>Javascript is a programming language that I am still working on improving. I have done a few online courses, through YouTube, 
                Skillshare and currently through Codecademy and am enjoying improving my skills in this area.</p>
            </div>

            </br>

            <div id="skill4">
            <h4>jQuery</h4>
            <p>jQuery has made Javascript functionality available to me while I continue to study. Although I still have more to learn and know there is 
                functionality I haven't yet tried I understand the basics enough to be able to use it with some research.</p>
            </div>
            
        
            </br>
            <div id="skill5">
            <h4>Bootstrap</h4>
            <p>Bootstrap is my latest skill to learn and it has allowed my 
                portfolio to become responsive in a short amount of time. I am enjoying seeing how flexible it can be and see how it 
                is such a useful tool for fast website building.</p>
