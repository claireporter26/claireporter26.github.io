                        <span class="aboutme_text--large">Hi, I'm Claire.</span> &nbsp I'm a self taught web developer based in West Sussex.<br>
                        I started to learn coding a few years ago after an online video caught my interest. Although I'd worked as a data analyst, I hadn't considered looking into programming as a career. I began by building my understanding of <b>HTML</b> and then soon started to delve into the exciting world of <b>CSS</b>. I knew that I had found something I was passionate about when my desire to study was strong enough to get me up early in the morning just to read about functions and design!
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="aboutme_text">
                        I decided the next step for me was to learn <b>JavaScript</b>. The language was initially difficult for me to pick up, but I was determined to crack it and now I finally have, allowing me to really build on my knowledge of how to use it effectively in my projects. 
                    </p>

                    <p class="aboutme_text">
                        I also have another love in my life; my little boy was born in 2019 and I've been lucky enough to spend more time with him this year than I would normally. It's been a balancing act to spend enough time with my family, get enough sleep and still find the time I need to continue my programming journey, but the fact that I managed this, only goes to shows me that this really is the path for me.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="aboutme_text">
                        My current programming focus is to improve my JavaScript proficiency. My goal is to really excel at Front End Development and with each project build a greater understanding and skill base. My long term aim is to learn enough to become a Full Stack Developer and I'm looking forward to discovering which direction my passion for programming takes me from there.
